<div id="maincontent"> <p> Welcome all to my fabulous website dedicated to cat lovers like you and I. My care and time is extremely devoted to my beautiful feline Bernard. Most cat lovers such as myself will love this website and the small tidbits and pictures of cats and kittens alike. My love grew for cats at a very young age considering some of my first pets were cats. At first I feared the strange mystic of some cats and their unpredictable personalties but as I grew so did my love and appreciation for cats. Most people don't understand cats mysterious behavior but for the few lucky that do Congratulations!</p> <p><img scr=<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99286752@N05/9350178547/" title="images-1 by fair.tiana, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7358/9350178547_3cdfd4f2e2.jpg" width="260" height="193" alt="images-1"></a></p> <p>Bernard is a gray tabby american short hair breed. He is a playful hunter at night and a loving, caring pet during the day. </p>
