<p>I can't help my greatness I was like this at birth and because I'm so awesome I developed super powers and my super powers were also pure greatness.<p> Even though at times my greatness is under appreciated I've forgive those ignorant minded few.</p> Greatness is only recognized by other greatness.:)</p> 
Furthermore I would like to add in some of my small but great accomplishments like saving the day when it was about to rain I had to stop it,<p> some my wonder how I did such a great thing well let me answer that question for you I did it by simply being me.;)</p> So take notes kids always be yourself you just might be great. <p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com"> Click here</a></p><img src="http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/0f40ed2cd05a11e2900c22000a1fb715_7.jpg"width="2000"height="2000">
