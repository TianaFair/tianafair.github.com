<div id="maincontent"><p>My cat Bernard is american short hair breed. I found Bernard when he was a small kitten outside abandoned. I instantly fell in love with him and took him into my home and the rest is history; he is now a one year old happy playful cat. Bernard drives my passion for cats as I learn something new about him every day my fascination for cats grow. I know Bernard is still a very young cat and has a lot more growing to do, but my love for him has driven me to start this website and show my love for not only him but all cats <img src="http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/24d75a886a6e11e2bc2222000a1f98f9_7.jpg"></p>
